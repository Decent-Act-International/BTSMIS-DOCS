                    The Union module serves as a centralized database for managing information and documents related
                    to various labor unions or trade unions. Each union is represented by a unique profile that
                    contains essential details and associated documents. Here are some key features and
                    functionalities of this module:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Union Profiles:</strong> Each labor union or trade union has a dedicated profile that
                    includes information such as the union's name, address, contact details, and other relevant
                    information.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Document Management:</strong> The module allows the union profile to be associated with
                    various documents, such as union constitutions, meeting minutes, collective bargaining
                    agreements, grievance records, membership lists, and other important documents specific to the
                    union.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Document Versioning:</strong> To maintain data integrity, the app may include version
                    control features to track changes made to documents associated with a union over time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to union profiles and associated documents can be
                    controlled based on user roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized users, such as
                    union representatives and administrators, can view and manage sensitive union-related
                    information.

                <br />
                <p>
                    The Union List module provides a user-friendly interface that displays a comprehensive list of
                    all the labor unions or trade unions managed within the document management app. It serves as a
                    navigational tool to access individual union profiles and their associated documents
                    efficiently. Here are some key aspects of this module:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>List View:</strong> The module presents a tabular or grid-based view of all unions,
                    showing essential details such as union names, locations, and contact information.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Search and Filters:</strong> Users can search for specific unions based on various
                    criteria, such as union name, location, or any custom fields defined for union profiles.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Quick Access:</strong> Clicking on a union's name or profile entry in the list leads to
                    the detailed profile of that union within the Union module.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Sorting:</strong> The list may support sorting options, allowing users to arrange unions
                    alphabetically, by location, or other relevant attributes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Integration with Union Module:</strong> The Union List module is closely integrated with
                    the Union module. Clicking on a union in the list provides immediate access to their detailed
                    profile and associated documents.
                    By combining the Factory and Factory List modules, the document management app provides an
                    efficient way to manage and access documents related to various factories or manufacturing
                    facilities. It streamlines the process of handling factory-related information, improves
                    document retrieval, and ensures data security and privacy. This setup also enhances the overall
                    organization and management of important records for each factory within the system.
