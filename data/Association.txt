                <p>
                    The Association module serves as a central repository for managing information and documents related to various associations or organizations. Each association is represented by a unique profile that contains essential details and associated documents. Here are some key features and functionalities of this module:
                    <br />
                    <strong>Association Profiles:</strong> Each association has a dedicated profile that includes information such as the association's name, address, contact details, and other relevant information.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Document Management:</strong> The module allows the association profile to be associated with various documents, such as legal agreements, bylaws, meeting minutes, financial reports, and other important records specific to the association.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Document Versioning:</strong> To maintain data integrity, the app may include version control features to track changes made to documents associated with an association over time.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong>  Access to association profiles and associated documents can be controlled based on user roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized users can view and manage sensitive association-related information.

                <strong>Association List:</strong>
                <p>
                    The Association List module provides a user-friendly interface that displays a comprehensive list of all the associations or organizations managed within the document management app. It serves as a navigational tool to access individual association profiles and their associated documents efficiently. Here are some key aspects of this module:
                    <br />
                    <strong>List View:</strong> The module presents a tabular or grid-based view of all associations, showing essential details such as names, addresses, and contact information.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Search and Filters:</strong> Users can search for specific associations based on various criteria, such as association name, location, or any custom fields defined for association profiles.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Quick Access:</strong> Clicking on an association's name or profile entry in the list leads to the detailed profile of that association within the Association module.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Sorting:</strong> The list may support sorting options, allowing users to arrange associations alphabetically, by location, or other relevant attributes.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Integration with Union Module:</strong>  The Association List module is closely integrated with the Association module. Clicking on an association in the list provides immediate access to their detailed profile and associated documents.
                    <br />
                    By combining the Association and Association List modules, the document management app provides an efficient way to manage and access documents related to various associations or organizations. It streamlines the process of handling association-related information, improves document retrieval, and ensures data security and privacy. This setup also enhances the overall organization and management of important records for each association within the system.
