                <strong>Add Workers:</strong>
                <p>
                    The Workers module is a central database that contains comprehensive information about individual
                    workers or employees within an organization. It acts as a repository for various worker-related
                    documents and data. Here are some of the key features and functionalities of this module:
                    <br />
                    Each worker is represented by a unique profile that includes personal details such as name, contact
                    information, address, and other identifying information.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Worker Profiles:</strong> Each worker is represented by a unique profile that includes
                    personal details such as name, contact information, address, and other identifying information.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Employment Details:</strong> The module contains information about the worker's job title,
                    department, designation, date of hire, employment status (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.), and
                    other relevant employment details.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Documentation Management:</strong> Various worker-related documents are associated with each
                    worker's profile. These documents may include resumes, CVs, cover letters, offer letters, employment
                    contracts, certificates, training records, performance appraisals, disciplinary actions, and more.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Document Versioning:</strong> The module may implement version control to track changes to
                    worker-related documents over time, ensuring that the most recent and accurate information is
                    available.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to worker profiles and associated documents is often
                    restricted based on user roles and permissions. This ensures that sensitive information is only
                    accessible to authorized personnel, such as HR managers and supervisors.

                <strong>Workers List:</strong>
                <p>
                    The Workers List module is a user-friendly interface that displays a comprehensive list of all the
                    workers or employees in the organization. It serves as a navigational tool to access individual
                    worker profiles and their associated documents efficiently. Here are some key aspects of this
                    module:
                    <br />
                    <strong>List View:</strong> The module typically presents a tabular or grid-based view of all
                    workers, showing essential details such as names, job titles, departments, and designations.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Search and Filters:</strong> The Workers List module allows users to search for specific
                    workers based on various criteria, such as name, department, designation, or any custom fields
                    defined for workers' profiles.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Quick Access:</strong> Users can click on a worker's name or profile entry in the list to
                    access their detailed profile and view the documents associated with them.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Sorting:</strong> The list may support sorting options, allowing users to arrange workers in
                    alphabetical order, by hire date, or other relevant attributes.
                    <br />
                    <strong>Integration with Workers Module:</strong> The Workers List module is closely integrated with
                    the Workers module. Clicking on a worker's name in the list leads to their detailed profile within
                    the Workers module.
                    <br />
                    By combining the Workers and Workers List modules, the document management app provides an efficient
                    and organized way to manage worker-related documents and information. It streamlines the process of
                    accessing worker profiles and associated documents, improves document retrieval, and ensures data
                    security and privacy. Additionally, it enhances the overall efficiency of workforce management
                    within the organization.
